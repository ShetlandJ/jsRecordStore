# JS Record Store

Your task is to use JS TDD to model a Record Store.

Use constructors and prototypes throughout as well.

## Part B

- Create a method that allows the store to view all Records of a given Genre.

## Part C

- Create a RecordCollector (or Customer) constructor who can buy and sell records.
- The RecordCollector should have cash that increase and decreases with buying and selling.
- The RecordCollector shouldn't be able to buy a Record if he can't afford it.
- The RecordCollector should be able to view the total value of their collection
- The RecordCollector should be able to view the total value of all records of a given Genre
- The RecordCollector should be able to view their most valuable record.
- The RecordCollector should be able to sort their records by value. (ascending or descending)
- The RecordCollector should be able to compare the value of their collection with another RecordCollector


## Extension

- If you haven't already: refactor your code to use enumeration throughout.
